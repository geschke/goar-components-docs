# goar-components

## THIS IS A TEST ONLY! PLEASE BE PATIENT FOR FINAL PUBLISHED VERSION!

## Introduction

Welcome to `goar-components`, a small Vue.js component library that originated from practical needs in a larger project.

This library came to life when a set of components, initially developed for a specific project, showed potential for reuse. The decision to extract these components into a separate library was driven by the simple idea of making them available for future projects.

Built on Vue.js, `goar-components` follows Bootstrap's design principles, aiming to offer a handful of useful components that integrate well with Bootstrap-based projects. It's important to note that this library doesn't aim to be comprehensive or to replace more established component libraries. Instead, it offers a modest selection of components that might prove helpful in certain scenarios.

The components in this library were created to solve specific challenges encountered during development. While they may not cover all possible use cases, they might save some time for developers facing similar needs.

`goar-components` is shared with the community in the spirit of open source collaboration. It's a small contribution to the vast ecosystem of Vue.js components, and hopefully, it might be useful for other developers working on similar projects.

Feel free to explore the components and use them if they fit your needs. Feedback and suggestions are always appreciated, as they can help improve the library over time.
